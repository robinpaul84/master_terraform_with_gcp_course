This lab will create a vpc network with cidr 10.0.0.0/
public subnet will be created with cidr 10.10.10.0/24 
private subnet will be created with cidr 10.10.20.0/24
3 firewall rules are created    
    allow-ssh -> inbound rule to allow ssh traffic on tcp port 22 from any ip range
    allow-http-rule-intenal -> inbound rule to allow http traffic on tcp port 80- from ip range - 10.10.10./24
    allow-http-rule -> inbound rule to allow http traffic on tcp port 80 - from any ip range

2 vm instance 
    private-instance on private subnetwork - 10.10.20.0/24
    public-instance on public subnetwork - 10.10.10.2/24

http traffic to public instance is allowed via inbound rule - allow-http-rule 
ssh traffic to public instance is allowed via inbound rule - allow-ssh
http traffic to private instance is allowed via inbound rule - allow_http_internal - allowed only from public subnetwork


vpc are global and not region based
subnetwork is region specific ie. subnet is created on a region
compute engine is avaialability zone specific ie. virtual machines or compute enginer are created on avaialability zones
