What is app engine : 


write your code in any of the supported languages,
or run custom containers with the language and framework
of your choice.
When your code is ready, run gcloud app deploy.
Mostly used for deploying services and apps in the form of code.
You can easily host different versions of your app and split
traffic between them for A/B testing and incremental feature
rollouts.

app Engine handles the work of uploading your code
and running it on Google Cloud.
It seamlessly scales from zero to millions of requests

App Engine offers free managed SSL certificates
on your custom domain , there by providing security to your app

It auto scales from 0 to unlimited instances (It uses GCE underneath). It comes with 2 flavors Standard Environment and Flexible Environment.
Standard Environment is really fast, scales down to 0 instances when no-one is using your app, scales up and down in seconds and has 
dedicated Google services and libraries for caching, authentication etc. The caveat with Standard environment is that it is very restrictive
since it runs in a sandbox.

google console shell demo:
You have to use gcloud cli to create app engine services

gcloud init
cd app_glcoudshell  
gcloud app deploy 
terraform :
if you get access issues (error creating StandardAppVersion: googleapi: Error 403: App Engine Admin API has not been used in project),
 then enable App Engine Admin API in google console


terraform plan  -var="deployment_version=1"
terraform apply  -var="deployment_version=1"

once done with your lessons :
go to google cloud console and make sure to delete all versions manually if not deleted by terraform
dont forget to disable app - 
    To disable an application; visit the Cloud  Console > App Engine > Settings > Disable Application button
